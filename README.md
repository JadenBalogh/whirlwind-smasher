# Whirlwind Smasher - BC Hacks 2021 1st Place Winner
Whirlwind Smasher is a 2D side scrolling game that lets the player play almost infinitely if they have the skill to do so. The player can click and drag or swipe if on mobile to throw their character Grog into the flurry with his fist ready to break anything that stands in his way. Enemies, barrels, walls are all nothing to Grog's fist! When he defeats an enemy or barrel using his whirlwind fist he gains an energy boost getting ready to fly further and defeat more foes.

Careful though, if Grog is not in his whirlwind state when hitting an enemy or obstacle in his way then Grog will take a massive penalty to his energy from his injuries and no longer have the drive to move any more!

While in the whirlwind state Grog can smash through just about anything but he uses his limited supply of energy to wind up his fist. The player must balance how much energy they use to the distance they travel in order to achieve the highest score and win!
